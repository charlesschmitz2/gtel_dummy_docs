## What to do once you have the code:
For this project we used Azure DevOps as our project management tool. This tool contains a lot of fancy features that support the agile method of program development. For this project, the todo's section is the most simple to use but the option to dive into the many features of this software are their if you so wish.

In the event that anything goes wrong a backup of the code should be saved with Marist through Professor Algozzine (email below). As well as with Gtel with Devin Overington (email below).

The professor in charge of looking over this project and acting as our boss is Christopher Algozzine. He can be reached at:

ðŸ“§ [christopher.algozzine@marist.edu](mailto:christopher.algozzine@marist.edu)
